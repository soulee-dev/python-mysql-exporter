# python-mysql-exporter
**PyMyExporter** seamlessly retrieves data from Prometheus's MySQL Exporter and transforms them into Python objects for easier handling and integration.

## Roadmap

1. **Direct MySQL Access**: Just as Prometheus's MySQL Exporter directly accesses MySQL data, PyMyExporter will eventually support direct data retrieval from MySQL, bypassing the need for intermediary exporters.
2. **User-Friendly API**: Provide a streamlined and intuitive API to enable effortless data fetching for users.
